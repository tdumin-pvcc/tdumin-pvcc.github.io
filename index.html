  <h2>The ethics and legality of browsing through other's files on a shared computer</h2>
  <h3><i>Is it really a smart thing to do?</i></h3>
<p>Suppose you are using a multiuser operating system that allows you to view the names of the files belonging to other users as well as to view the contents of those files that are not otherwise protected. Would viewing such information without permission be similar to wandering through someone’s unlocked home without permission, or would it be more like reading materials placed in a common lounge such as a physician’s waiting room? </p>
  <p>If the computer is shared, is it really ethical or legal to look through other people’s files? From a legal standpoint, it’s not really illegal unless there is a lock on the file. From an ethics standpoint, it’s probably not ethical to do so, but it can depend on what you are looking at. If you are just looking through a meme folder, then probably not a terrible thing. If you are looking at their family photos, that's weird and probably not super ethical. This was a question asked to my class, and here are some of the answers:.</p>
  <p>"If you are using a multiuser operating system, you should treat it like a public area. It's not for your own use only; other people use it too. It would be rude to wander through the files, like looking through a coworker's desk or a sibling's toybox, but it's not quite to the level of looking through an unlocked house." - My response.
</p>
  <p>"I disagree and believe even if someone did recklessly leave files on a public computer you should still not go through them. You could try to find the person and tell them they had left files out in the open but I don't think it gives you permission to dig through them. It's like if someone dropped a wallet you shouldn't just take their cards and their money." - Another classmate's response.
</p>
  <p>"I agree that the question kind of overstated the severity of the scenario, and I definitely think that a multi-user system should be treated like a public area. I have never assumed any expectation of privacy on public, work, or school computers, and I've always set up encrypted home folders on my home computers." - Another classmate's response</p>
  <p>Encrypted folders? That’s a pretty good way to keep your stuff safe on a shared computer. Although it’s not completely safe from your administrators, it will be safe from your coworkers. Most techs will dig through unprotected folders since they consider it “fair game.” There’s also some other things you can do to protect your privacy on a shared computer. </p>
  <p>1. Don’t stay signed in to personal accounts. It’s not legal for people or companies to look through your personal accounts, but that might not stop them.</p>
  <p>2. Don’t connect your phone (such as through microsoft’s phone link app) to the computer for general safety reasons.</p>
  <p>3. Don’t look up stuff you don’t want other people seeing. Your admins, or coworkers, could find that and it can be embarrassing or lead to punishment. </p>
  <p>Keeping your stuff protected from your nosey coworkers isn’t hard if you just use your own computer. If that isn’t an option for you, let this be a simple reminder of what admins and coworkers might be able to do on a shared computer. It’s also a reminder of what you can do on one if you feel up to it. My personal suggestion is to not go browsing through other people’s files, just for the sake of their privacy. You wouldn’t want anyone going through your files, would you? However, it is a public space, so go browsing through to your heart’s content, that is if you are feeling up to it. </p>
